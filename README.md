-## üöÄ Getting Started
-
-### Prerequisites
+### Requirements
 - Python 3.11+
 - Node.js 20+ (with pnpm or npm)
-- [Ollama installed](https://ollama.ai/) and at least one model pulled (e.g. `llama2:13b`)
-
-### Setup
-### One-command dev
-
-With [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) and the `llama3` model installed:
-
-```bash
-make dev
-```
-
-This launches both the FastAPI backend and the Vite frontend.
-
-### Manual setup
-
-```bash
-# Clone repo
-git clone https://github.com/your-username/local-ai-ttrpg.git
-cd local-ai-ttrpg
-
-# Backend setup
-cd server
-uv venv
-uv pip install -r requirements.txt
-uv run fastapi dev
-
-# Frontend setup
-cd ../web
-pnpm install
-pnpm dev
-```
-
-Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`
-Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`

-## üé≤ Gameplay Loop
-1. Player types an **action** (`"I open the chest"`).  
-2. AI DM narrates and may **request a roll** (`"Roll a d20 for Perception (DC 15)"`).
